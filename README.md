custom gpt for assistants: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-RnBKKiEhD-swarm-assistants-ai

Todo 
1. go through assistants docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview 

Doc Notes
-  Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling
- Assistant: instruction (how they should respond) --> pick a MODEL --> tools like code intereperter --> functions 

TO UNDERSTAND
- STEP 1 - Create an Assistant - this is the AI that you create and can call on at anytime. Example, we are building a trader AI that can research, code and backtest trading strategies

- STEP 2 - Create a Thread - you and your friend laquisha are texting, you guys have a thread of messages on imessage or bunky androids.. thats a thread, but with your above AI. Threads dont have a limit to messages. Open ai will handle all that. 

- STEP 3 - add messages to a thread -- you and your friend laquisha have messages all saved to one thread. thats just how it is with thread OAI
